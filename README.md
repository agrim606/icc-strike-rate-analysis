## ICC Strike Rate Analysis

This project presents a deep-dive data analysis of batting performances in ICC tournaments. It focuses on key metrics such as **strike rate**, **run totals**, **boundary-hitting ability**, and **finishing consistency** across international cricket teams and players.  

The goal is to uncover strategic differences between teams, evaluate player efficiency, and gain insights into how different nations structure their batting line-ups using real performance data.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze and compare **batting strike rates** across countries and individual players.
- Identify top performers in terms of **total runs**, **high scores**, **4s**, **6s**, and **batting average**.
- Observe **consistency and finishing roles** through "not out" frequency.
- Reveal **innings longevity** by analyzing players who faced the most balls.
- Understand **team-wise trends** in batting intent and efficiency.

## Key Insights and Visualizations

### Team-Wise Metrics
- **Strike Rate**: Australia topped with ~101; India lowest at ~81.
- **Six Count**: NZ (713), AUS (682), IND (647) dominate six-hitting.
- **Average**: Kuwait and Namibia lead with high averages ‚Äî showing stability.

### Player-Wise Performance
- **Top Scorers**: Kohli (2633), Guptill (2436), Warner (2079)
- **Six-Hitters**: Warner and Rohit Sharma lead among 4s hitters.
- **Finishers**: MS Dhoni, Shoaib Malik, JP Duminy top ‚Äúnot out‚Äù innings ‚Äî crucial for stability.

### Deep-Dives
- Comparative analysis of:
  - **Top 5 Indian**, **Australian**, and **New Zealand** batsmen by SR, average, and highest score
  - **Top 10 boundary-hitters** (4s and 6s) with their strike rate and averages

## Sample Visualizations

- üìå Bar Charts for:
  - Top countries by strike rate, average, sixes, total runs
- üìå Line Graphs:
  - Comparing strike rate, average, and highest score across key players
- üìå Multi-metric Plots:
  - For boundary-hitters analyzing 4s, 6s, SR, and average in one frame

All plots are generated using `Matplotlib` and styled for clarity.

## Key Takeaways

* Teams with higher strike rates consistently dominate in modern limited-overs cricket.
* Star players like Virat Kohli combine average with aggression, while others shine in specific roles (e.g., finishers or power hitters).
* Associate nations are rising with aggressive formats, reflected in SR and six counts.
* **Strike Rate, Sixes, and "Not Outs"** offer a more complete performance picture than just runs or averages.


## About Me
